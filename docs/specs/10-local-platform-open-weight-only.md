## Purpose

This mode is the long-term sovereignty target.

The platform keeps the existing Herdr + LiteLLM routing spine, deterministic triage, prompt adaptation, `failup.py` verification, plan-first decomposition, and `measure.py` telemetry. The policy boundary changes: **no proprietary model is ever eligible for inference**.

Hosted inference is still allowed. The requirement is that the model weights are publicly downloadable **and** the grant they ship under is on the approved list. Remote providers supply compute, not a closed intellectual dependency.

Those are two conditions, not one, and conflating them was the original defect in this document. See "Core principle".

---

## Core principle

> **Open weights first, local whenever practical, hosted when economically rational, proprietary inference never.**

The goal is not “every token must be generated inside the house.”

The goal is:

> **100% of normal model inference is served by approved open-weight models, with local hardware handling the economically sensible share and metered remote GPUs handling workloads that exceed local capacity.**

### The eligibility test is `license_family`, not `open_weight`

This mode was originally written on the assumption that published weights imply
an acceptable license. **Kimi K3 falsified that assumption** (CW-04 §2.5): its
weights shipped publicly on 2026-07-27 under a bespoke grant carrying a
revenue-triggered separate-agreement clause for Model-as-a-Service operators and
a UI attribution mandate above 100M monthly active users. Neither MIT nor
Apache. `open_weight: true` would have admitted it.

So the registry carries a required `license_family` field, and **this policy
mode tests that field**. Its six values are `permissive`, `weak_copyleft`,
`strong_copyleft`, `non_permissive`, `proprietary`, `unverified`.
`unverified` **fails closed** — it is deliberately not allowlist-eligible, so a
grant nobody has actually read cannot pass on the strength of downloadable
weights.

Where the live roster sits today:

| `license_family` | Rows |
|---|---|
| `permissive` | `nomic-embed-text` (Apache-2.0); all four DeepSeek V4 Flash rows (MIT) |
| `unverified` | all three Gemma 4 rows (custom Google grant, use restrictions, unread); `minimax-m3`; `deepseek-v4-pro` |
| `non_permissive` | both Kimi K3 rows (`Kimi-K3-Custom`) |
| `proprietary` | `gpt-5.6-sol` — absent from this mode by definition |

Two consequences worth stating plainly. First, **most of the local ladder is
`unverified` right now**, so a strict reading of this mode does not yet clear
its own local rungs; reading the Gemma grant is outstanding work, not a
formality. Second, like the T-numbers, the mode is a label rather than a runtime
check: nothing in `src/` reads `license_family` except the renderer that copies
it into `model_info`. `open_weight_only` is enforced by which rows a config
variant carries, not by a selector that could reject one.

## Scale 1 footprint

### Existing hardware

- **iMac** — always-on routing and local inference host
- **MacBook Pro** — opportunistic second local inference worker
- **2 TB NVMe** — fast active AI workspace, models, vector stores, environments, and working datasets
- **8 TB Seagate** — bulk storage, model archive, dataset archive, and backup tier

### Future hardware

- **High-memory local AI node** — target roughly 128 GB of model-accessible memory
- Added only when Herdr telemetry shows that local model capacity is a recurring constraint

```

There is no Claude, proprietary GPT, Gemini, Sonar, or other closed-model fallback. `proprietary_research` (GPT-5.6 Sol) exists in the hybrid registry at T6 and is simply absent from this mode's config variant; `proprietary_code` (Anthropic) does not exist in either — CC-P6 deleted the row outright.

**Two things sit off that chain and are drawn apart from it deliberately:**

```text
  ── not rungs, at any T-number ──────────────────────────────────────────

  FABLE TIER — Kimi K3  (moonshot/kimi-k3)
      Reached ONLY by an explicit human declaration that a specific task
      warrants it, with the reason logged. Never by a stall, a verifier
      failure, or any other escalation. It is not rung 7 and it is not
      the step after CEILING_STALL — it is off the escalation graph.
      Carried as `fable_tier: true` + `enabled: false`.
      ABSENT IN THIS MODE: weights are public, but `license_family` is
      `non_permissive`, so it fails the eligibility test above. It is
      excluded on LICENCE, not on hosting — which is exactly the
      distinction this mode exists to make.

  OpenRouter
      OFF THE LADDER entirely (CW-04 §2.2) — not a rung at any
      T-number, and not drawn as one because it is not one. Its defined
      role is a non-routable failover path tagged `unbenched`, reachable
      only when a first-party endpoint health-checks down.
      THAT PATH IS UNBUILT. The schema carries a `failover_only` field
      for it and NO row sets it, because any row rendered into an
      alias's model group is routable by LiteLLM's own retry/fallback
      regardless of what `model_info` says — the tag would be a comment,
      not a control. Nothing routes through OpenRouter today. Building
      the health-check-gated call path is HB-2 work.
```

## Inference ladder

### 0. `deterministic`

No model call yet.

Responsibilities:

- sensitive-content pinning
- explicit overrides
- task-shape rules
- triage for underspecified requests
- lint/test command discovery
- routing-policy enforcement
- `license_family` allowlist checks (not `open_weight` — see "Core principle")

This remains the cheapest and most reliable rung.

---

### 1. `local_fast`

**Primary host:** always-on iMac.

Purpose:

- task classification
- prompt adaptation support
- bounded code edits
- routine R/Python/SQL work
- summarization
- extraction
- lightweight code review
- embeddings
- small specialist models
- inexpensive first-pass agent work

This tier should favor models that remain responsive on the iMac rather than chasing maximum parameter count.

**Current occupants** (CW-04 §2.4; live in `registry.yaml`):

| Alias | Model | Host | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `classifier` | `gemma4:e4b` | iMac | sole occupant, no `order` needed. Kept warm at `OLLAMA_KEEP_ALIVE=-1` — the alias that wants a warm model lives where the warm model lives |
| `code_small` | `gemma4:12b` (Q4) | MacBook | `order: 1` |
| `code_small` | `gemma4:e4b` | iMac | `order: 2`, the fallback |
| `embedding` | `nomic-embed-text` | iMac | single deployment, no failover. Changing the embedder mid-corpus invalidates the vector store, so this pin is stickier than the rest of the ladder |

Qwen3-Coder 7B is retired from the documented roster entirely (CW-04 §2.4) and appears nowhere in the live registry.

The 12B lands on the **MacBook** first, deliberately: that machine carries no service co-tenancy, so it gives a clean quality read. The iMac runs LiteLLM, Postgres, Qdrant, Open WebUI, SearXNG and Docker on 16GB, and 12B Q4 is roughly 8GB of weights before KV cache. A steward swap requires a head-to-head bench against E4B under live co-tenancy first.

All three Gemma rows are `license_family: unverified` — the Gemma terms carry use restrictions, so `permissive` would be wrong and `non_permissive` would be a guess about a grant nobody in this repo has read. That value fails closed, which means this mode does not currently clear its own local rungs on a strict reading. Reading the grant is real outstanding work.

Recommended policy:

```yaml
capability: local_fast
availability: required
cost_class: local
privacy: local
```

---

### 2. `local_fast`, second deployment (formerly `local_burst`)

**Host:** MacBook Pro when online.

No longer a tier (CW02 §2.1): tiers are capability rungs, machines are
deployments. The MacBook runs the same models as the iMac, so escalating to it
buys no capability — LiteLLM load-balances it inside `local_fast` with health
checks. It is not extra RAM for the iMac; it is a second inference worker.

Best uses:

- parallel subtasks
- independent code review
- test generation
- secondary-agent work
- specialist models
- background indexing
- larger local models when the MacBook itself has more unified memory

If the MacBook is asleep or off-network:

```text
result = unavailable
```

not:

```text
result = model_failed
```

This distinction is essential so `measure.py` does not interpret missing hardware as a model-quality failure.

---

### 3. `local_large`

**Future host:** high-memory local AI node.

Recommended target:

- roughly **128 GB** of model-accessible memory
- fast local NVMe
- high-speed Ethernet preferred
- headless operation
- Tailscale/SSH administration
- Ollama, llama.cpp, or another approved local inference runtime behind LiteLLM

This tier should expose **capability aliases**, not hard-coded permanent model names:

```text
code_large
research_synthesis
```

The model behind each alias should be selected by Parity Bench results.
The alias vocabulary is the seven-cell set in CW02-decisions §3; the former
`local/*` namespace is retired — where a capability runs is a deployment
property, not part of the alias.

The purpose of this node is to make substantially larger open-weight models locally available without replacing the iMac as the normal workstation.

---

### 4. `remote_open_direct` (T3)

**Provider: DeepSeek, first-party** — `api.deepseek.com`, reached through
LiteLLM's native `deepseek/` route.

Herdr selects the model *and* the surface serving it. There is no delegated
infrastructure choice at this rung, and that is the point rather than a
limitation.

**Why direct rather than aggregated.** DeepSeek's first-party API does automatic
prefix caching, billing a repeated prefix at roughly 2% of the miss rate. That
cache is the reason this rung's economics work, and it is a first-party
behaviour — routing the same model through an intermediary forfeits it. This is
the single reason T3 exists as a separate rung from T4 rather than collapsing
into it (CW-04 §2.2, and §4 item 1 keeps the collapse open as a live question
if Morph turns out to carry an equivalent cache).

**Occupants.** Two checkpoints and one re-run:

| Model | Where | `license_family` | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| `deepseek-v4-flash` | `code_large` order 1, `research_synthesis` order 1 | `permissive` (MIT, confirmed 2026-08-05, weights public on Hugging Face) | the **cheap first attempt**, before the primary occupant — not a fallback |
| `deepseek-v4-pro` | `research_synthesis` order 2 | `unverified` | the primary occupant for research synthesis |
| `deepseek-v4-flash` @ `reasoning_effort: max` | order 3 on both ladders | `permissive` | "Flash Max" — see §5 |

Note the shape: **Flash comes *before* the primary occupant, not after.** The
order numbers ascend by cost, so they are literally the escalation order.

**Controls that apply here:**

- hard model allowlist, expressed as *which rows exist in `registry.yaml`* — a
  model that is not a row is not a deployment
- `license_family` on every row, checked at T0, `unverified` failing closed
- no fallback to a model outside the registry
- benchmark per endpoint, not per model name

Serving precision needs no filter at this rung because there is no intermediary
that could change it.

**What this actually renders to.** `render_config.py` reads `registry.yaml` and
emits `model_list.generated.yaml`; both it and `config.yaml` are gitignored
build artifacts — never hand-edit them. This is the real rendered shape, not an
illustration:

```yaml
model_list:
- model_name: research_synthesis
  litellm_params:
    model: deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash
    api_key: os.environ/DEEPSEEK_API_KEY
    order: 1
  model_info:
    portage_alias: research_synthesis
    enabled: true
    open_weight: true
    license: MIT
    license_family: permissive
    max_context: 1048576
    supports_tools: true
    supports_json: true
    data_classification: public
    benchmark_version: null
    bfclv3: null
    ifeval: null
- model_name: research_synthesis
  litellm_params:
    model: deepseek/deepseek-v4-pro
    api_key: os.environ/DEEPSEEK_API_KEY
    order: 2
  model_info:
    portage_alias: research_synthesis
    enabled: true
    open_weight: true
    license: UNVERIFIED
    license_family: unverified
    max_context: 1048576
    supports_tools: true
    supports_json: true
    data_classification: public
    benchmark_version: null
    bfclv3: null
    ifeval: null
```

Endpoints and keys are `os.environ/` references, never literals, so the file
stays portable. `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` is LiteLLM's own key name for this provider.

`deepseek-v4-flash` and `deepseek-v4-pro` are the vendor's **documented** names
and have not been confirmed against a live `/v1/models` on DeepSeek's own API.
Both carry a `TODO(native)` in `registry.yaml`. The B7 gate governs: pins change
only after the model is reached and passes the per-model tool-call smoke test.

---

### 5. `remote_open_broad` (T4)

**Provider: Morph** — bf16 activations, no quantization, one key, reached
through LiteLLM's native `morph/` route.

**Why Morph and not an aggregator.** Every alias in this platform is a benchmark
cell, and reproducibility is one of the six inclusion criteria. An aggregator
that can change quantization under a stable model ID makes the cell
irreproducible — the same model name silently becomes a different measurement.
Morph serves open models at 16-bit activations without quantization *and says
so*. That single test is what removed six providers from consideration (CW-04
§2.2, §3) and it is why this rung is a named vendor rather than a routing layer.

**Occupant:** MiniMax M3 (`morph/minimax-m3`), `code_large` order 2 —
`license_family: unverified`, because MiniMax M2 shipped MIT but M3's grant is
not confirmed. GLM-5.2 and Qwen sit in-slot behind the same key if either is
ever wanted, with no new account and no new inclusion review.

**"Flash Max" — a second rung on the same checkpoint.** After the Morph occupant
comes `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash` again at `reasoning_effort: max` (order 3 on
both ladders). This is **the same checkpoint as order 1, not a separate model**.
Buying more thinking on a model that already passed the cheap attempt is a
cheaper escalation than onboarding a new vendor.

> **Caveat, unresolved.** `litellm_settings.yaml` sets `drop_params: true`. If
> DeepSeek's API does not accept the literal `reasoning_effort: max`, LiteLLM
> drops the parameter **silently** and this rung collapses into a duplicate of
> order 1. It would not error; it would just quietly stop being a rung. Confirm
> at HB-0 Gate 2.

**What this actually renders to** — the complete `code_large` model group, which
is the clearest artifact in the whole config because a single alias's group
spans three tiers plus the Fable row:

```yaml
- model_name: code_large            # T3 — cheap first attempt
  litellm_params:
    model: deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash
    api_key: os.environ/DEEPSEEK_API_KEY
    order: 1
  model_info:
    portage_alias: code_large

    open_weight: true

    license_family: permissive
    max_context: 1048576

    data_classification: public
    benchmark_version: null
    bfclv3: null
    ifeval: null
- model_name: code_large            # T4 — the primary occupant
  litellm_params:
    model: morph/minimax-m3
    api_key: os.environ/MORPH_API_KEY
    order: 2
  model_info:
    portage_alias: code_large
    enabled: true
    open_weight: true
    license: UNVERIFIED
    license_family: unverified
    max_context: 1048576
    supports_tools: true
    supports_json: true
    data_classification: public
    benchmark_version: null
    bfclv3: null
    ifeval: null
- model_name: code_large            # T4 — "Flash Max", same checkpoint as order 1
  litellm_params:
    model: deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash
    api_key: os.environ/DEEPSEEK_API_KEY
    order: 3
    reasoning_effort: max
  model_info:
    portage_alias: code_large
    enabled: true
    open_weight: true
    license: MIT
    license_family: permissive
    max_context: 1048576
    supports_tools: true
    supports_json: true
    data_classification: public
    benchmark_version: null
    bfclv3: null
    ifeval: null
    effort: max
- model_name: code_large            # FABLE TIER — off the ladder, see below
  litellm_params:
    model: moonshot/kimi-k3
    api_key: os.environ/MOONSHOT_API_KEY
    order: 5
  model_info:
    portage_alias: code_large
    enabled: false
    open_weight: true
    license: Kimi-K3-Custom
    license_family: non_permissive
    max_context: 262144
    supports_tools: true
    supports_json: true
    data_classification: public
    benchmark_version: null
    bfclv3: null
    ifeval: null
    fable_tier: true
```

**`order: 4` is deliberately vacant.** CC-P6 pinned the K3 row to `order: 5` on
this ladder and `order: 4` on research's, reasoning that research has no local
tier so its ladder is one shorter — which assumes `code_large` opens with a
local rung. CW-04 §2.3 does not give it one; the local coding rung is
`code_small`. So the K3 order is honoured literally and the implied slot is left
empty rather than silently renumbered. `order` gaps are inert: LiteLLM sorts on
the value and does not require contiguity. It is a decision, not a typo.

---

### 6. `remote_open_reserve` (T5) — DORMANT

Defined, disabled, and holding two unrelated re-enable triggers. Following the
CW-02 §2.1 dormant-slot idiom rather than deletion, so a vacated rung leaves a
written trigger behind instead of a hole.

> **Naming hazard.** This slot was called `remote_open_direct` under CW-02.
> CW-04 reassigned that name to **T3** (DeepSeek). Two different tiers have held
> the same name at different times — when reading anything dated before
> 2026-08-02, check which one is meant.

**Trigger (a) — a latency-sensitive alias that no local rung can serve.**
Occupant would be **Groq GPT-OSS 120B**, at roughly $0.15/$0.60 and ~500 tok/s,
and it enters **benched as its own capability cell, never as a route to an
existing roster model**. Groq previously held T3 and vacated it: its self-serve
catalog is Llama 3.1 8B / 3.3 70B, GPT-OSS 20B / Safeguard 20B / 120B, and Qwen
3.6 27B, plus MiniMax M2.7 enterprise-only — DeepSeek, Kimi, GLM and Mistral
have no path there, so it cannot serve the models this roster actually selects.
It also offers no prompt-caching discount, which removes the mechanism that
makes the direct-provider economics work (CW-04 §2.1).

**Trigger (b) — sustained Morph unavailability.** Occupant would be **Together
AI**: serverless per-token inference, no GPU provisioning, broad open-model
catalog, OpenAI-compatible. Together's original CW-02 trigger referenced
OpenRouter unavailability and is superseded by this one. This trigger is also
the standing mitigation for the one open half of Morph's inclusion-test
assessment, vendor durability (CW-04 §4 item 4).

**Neither is wired.** There are no Groq or Together rows in `registry.yaml`, no
keys in `.env.example`, and nothing routes to either. Re-enabling means adding
rows and running the inclusion test, not flipping a flag.

DeepInfra, Fireworks, Novita, Atlas, GMICloud and the other aggregators are
**rejected, not dormant** — serving precision is undocumented per endpoint,
which breaks a benchmark cell (CW-04 §3). They are recorded there with reasons
so a later pass does not silently reopen them.

---

## Model strategy

Do not build the architecture around a single “Claude replacement model.”

Use role-specific capability aliases.

```text
classifier
code_small
code_large
research_synthesis
embedding
```

Herdr then maps each capability to the currently best validated model.
Five open aliases here. `proprietary_research` exists only in hybrid mode
(docs/specs/11); **`proprietary_code` exists nowhere** — CC-P6 deleted the
Anthropic row outright rather than disabling it, so the deployment declares six
of the seven fixed aliases, and the seventh is absent rather than hidden.
`code_medium`, `vision`, `reranker` earn cells when telemetry shows a routing
decision that needs them (scale-mapping §4.3).

Candidate families should be selected from current downloadable open-weight
models — but "downloadable" is the entry condition, not the test. Each candidate
still has to clear `license_family`:

| Family | Status on this roster |
|---|---|
| DeepSeek | **in use** — V4 Flash (MIT, `permissive`) at T3 and as the Flash Max rung; V4 Pro (`unverified`) as research's primary |
| MiniMax | **in use** — M3 via Morph at T4, `unverified` |
| Gemma | **in use** — E4B and 12B Q4 locally, all `unverified` |
| GPT-OSS | dormant-only — 120B is T5's trigger-(a) occupant, benched as its own cell |
| GLM / Z.ai | available in-slot on Morph's key; Z.ai's own direct API is rejected (a second surface for one vendor, priced above MiniMax) |
| Qwen | available in-slot on Morph's key. Qwen3-Coder 7B is retired from the local roster |
| Kimi / Moonshot | **rejected for the routine roster** (CW-04 §2.5) on cost and licence together. K3 survives only as the off-ladder Fable tier, `non_permissive` |
| Llama, Mistral | no current occupant |

The exact winner is intentionally not permanent.

**Parity Bench decides — subject to the licence gate, which Parity Bench does
not get a vote on.**

CEILING_STALL


  ── and never from any box above ──────────────────────────────
  FABLE TIER (Kimi K3) is NOT the next step after CEILING_STALL
  and is not reachable from any arrow in this diagram. It is
  entered by a logged human declaration or not at all.
```

`failup.py` remains authoritative.

The model's statement that it succeeded is never sufficient.

One structural note, because the per-tier headings above can mislead: the
registry does **not** model these as separate deployment groups. Each capability
alias is one LiteLLM model group, and the rungs are `order` values inside it —
so `code_large` alone spans T3, T4, the Flash Max re-run, and the Fable row. The
tier vocabulary is documentation over a flat, ordered list, and `failup.py`
does not read it: the guard's ladder comes from `.claude/tiers.*.json`, whose
rung names and the registry's alias names do not intersect at all.

## Ceiling behavior

The final open-weight failure must **not** silently cross into proprietary inference.

Instead:

```text
last eligible open rung ("Flash Max", T4)
        |
      failure
        |
decompose task
        |
retry eligible open tiers
        |
      failure
        |
   CEILING_STALL     <- terminal. Not a doorway to the Fable
                        tier, and not a doorway to T6.
```

Log:

- task profile
- model attempts
- local vs. hosted
- context size
- acceptance command
- verifier result
- availability failures
- quality failures
- total open-inference cost
- best prior Parity Bench comparison

This makes the remaining open-model gap measurable.

## Research profile without Perplexity

The Science lane must replace Perplexity-style research with an open stack.

Recommended flow:

```text
query decomposition
       |
web / scholarly retrieval
       |
source normalization
       |
open-weight synthesis
       |
citation extraction
       |
citation-resolution verifier
       |
final answer
```

A self-hosted metasearch layer such as **SearXNG** is appropriate for general web discovery, supplemented by direct scholarly APIs/indexes for academic work.

The model must never be trusted to invent citations.

Every cited source must have been retrieved and validated by the citation-resolution verifier.

## Hardware-purchase rule

Do not buy the 128 GB node merely because larger models exist.

Buy it when Herdr data shows:

1. a material percentage of tasks fail because the best local model is too small;
2. hosted open-weight models solve those same tasks;
3. the expected local inference volume makes hardware economically preferable;
4. the quality gain from the larger open model is demonstrated by the personal Parity Bench.

This turns hardware acquisition into a measured capacity decision rather than a benchmark-driven guess.

## Recommended policy configuration

The provider-block form this section used to carry (`groq:`, `openrouter:`,
`together:`, `deepinfra:`, each with an `open_weight_only: true` toggle) never
existed in the built system and does not exist now. Two corrections at once:
those four providers are not the roster any more, and **there is no
per-provider policy toggle at all**. Policy is expressed as which rows exist in
`registry.yaml` and what `license_family` each carries. This is the real shape:

```yaml
# registry.yaml — the hand-edited source of truth. `render_config.py` turns
# this into litellm/config.yaml + model_list.generated.yaml, both gitignored
# build artifacts. Never hand-edit those.
#
# For open_weight_only, the config variant simply carries no row whose
# license_family is outside the allowlist — no toggle refuses one at runtime.

on_open_ceiling_failure:

```

The schema also defines `failover_only` (optional boolean, default false) for
CW-04 §2.2's OpenRouter demotion. **No row sets it**, deliberately: a row
rendered into an alias's model group is routable by LiteLLM's own
retry/fallback whatever `model_info` says, so a `failover_only: true` row inside
`code_large` would be exactly the routable rung the demotion removed. The field
is in place and waiting; the rows come back when HB-2 ships the mechanism that
makes them genuinely non-routable.

The same limitation is the honest caveat on the Fable gate: `enabled: false`
keeps K3 out of every downstream selector that filters on the flag, but LiteLLM
itself does not read `model_info.enabled`. A sustained outage of orders 1–3
could in principle have the proxy exhaust its retry budget and reach the K3
deployment. Narrowed, **not closed** — recorded as open in `P6-report.md` §1.

## Success metrics

Track at minimum:

```text
% solved by local_fast
% solved by the MacBook deployment (local_fast #2)
% solved by local_large
% solved by hosted open-weight
% ending in ceiling stall

cost per verified successful task
median latency by rung
tokens / context by rung
unavailable vs. not-good-enough failures
```

The critical metric is:

> **What percentage of real tasks receive a verified successful result without proprietary inference?**

---

## End state

The platform runs open-weight models locally whenever practical, rents remote GPU inference only when larger open models are justified, and treats a model-quality ceiling as measurable evidence rather than permission to invoke a closed model.

No recurring LLM subscription is required.

No proprietary model dependency remains.

## Current provider references

Provider capabilities change, so these should be revalidated periodically.

**Live rungs:**

- DeepSeek API (T3): https://api-docs.deepseek.com/ — model list, and the
  automatic prefix-caching behaviour this rung's economics depend on
- Morph (T4): https://docs.morphllm.com/ — the bf16 / no-quantization serving
  commitment is the inclusion criterion, so revalidate it specifically
- LiteLLM provider routes: `deepseek`, `morph`, `moonshot` are native in the
  pinned v1.93.0, resolving to `api.deepseek.com/beta`, `api.morphllm.com/v1`
  and `api.moonshot.ai/v1`; key names `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY`, `MORPH_API_KEY`,
  `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` come from LiteLLM's own transformation modules

**Dormant-slot references — not live rungs, listed only so the re-enable
triggers can be evaluated without re-researching from scratch:**

- Groq (T5 trigger (a)): https://console.groq.com/docs/models
- Together AI (T5 trigger (b)): https://docs.together.ai/docs/inference/overview

OpenRouter is intentionally not listed. It is not a rung, nothing routes
through it, and a link here would imply otherwise.
