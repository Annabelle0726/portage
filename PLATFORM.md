# PLATFORM.md — final definition: **Portage**

A self-hostable, verifier-driven, sovereignty-aware agent control plane for
Code, Science, Design, and Cowork — open-weight by default, benchmarked honestly
against the subscription products it replaces (Claude, ChatGPT/Codex,
Perplexity). This document is the capstone: it synthesizes the landscape survey
(`routing-layer-landscape-2026.md` — an external uploaded document, not in this
repo), the platform overview received from
Perplexity, and everything in `specs/00–09`, and it supersedes them where they
conflict. The name is settled: **Portage** (EduCloud umbrella `SYSTEM.md` §1;
prior working name Commons). The ethos it carries is public-infrastructure
Open Access.

---

## 1. What was adopted, corrected, and kept from the survey overview

**Adopted** (the overview got these right):
- **OpenHands** as the agent-execution and Cowork substrate (fleets, sandboxes,
  least-privilege, workflow-level usage tracking). Our thin core stays portable;
  OpenHands is the *execution* layer, not the identity of the platform.
- **LiteLLM Auto Routing + Adaptive Router** as the online routing spine, with
  **Postgres** as routing/outcome memory and **RouteLLM-style offline
  retraining** as the learning loop. This upgrades our static ladder into a
  router that *learns from verifier outcomes* — the natural completion of the
  measurement layer we already had.
- The **policy → router → verifier → learner** ordering, and the 3-mode framing
  (full-open / hybrid / sovereign) as policy configurations of one platform.

**Corrected** (where the overview was missing things we'd already solved):
- It has an eligibility filter but **no triage**: nothing catches an
  underspecified task before dispatch. Our clarify-before-dispatch classifier
  (deterministic pins first, local model second, uncertainty escalates upward)
  is reinstated as a mandatory stage between policy and router.
- It has no **plan-first decomposition with runnable per-subtask acceptance
  checks** and no human plan gate. Reinstated (specs/01; OpenSpec schema per
  specs/08).
- It logs "ceiling-stall" but lacks the **honesty gate** — the rule that an
  efficiency win is void if the stall rate rose. Reinstated as a platform-wide
  invariant, and generalized in the benchmark suite (§5) as non-inferiority.
- Its tier ladder is open-source-only; for the *benchmark* the subscription
  lanes must exist as first-class arms, so the meters layer (herdr-meters,
  quota accounting) is kept — not as product, as **instrumented baseline**.

**Kept from our build, unchanged:** the deterministic fail-up guard (verdict:
still novel), the sensitive-data pin by config absence, Herdr as the terminal
surface, the scheduling/off-hours drain, and the maintenance rails (pinning,
stub-LLM CI tests, nightly canary, Renovate custom datasource).

Escalation policy: **open-to-open first** (T1→T2→T3→T4→T5→T6) before any
open-to-closed step; T7 exists only in `hybrid` mode and is boundary-gated, never
reached just because it would perform better. Full ladder, mode table, and the
transition plan are in `REVISION-PLAN.md` and `specs/10`–`11`.

## 3. Modes

| Mode | Rungs | Constraint | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `open_weight_only` | T0–T6 | model_list contains no commercial endpoints; hosted-open (T5/T6) is allowed because the weights are downloadable, only the compute is rented | end state; also offline/air-gapped |
| `hybrid` | T0–T7 | T7 allowed only as a boundary-gated fail-up ceiling (verified open failure / documented specialist / explicit override) — never a fixed subscription rung | **current mode.** Daily driving during the Scale-1 pilot |
| `sovereign` | T0–T4 | all routes pinned local + institutional; commercial *and* hosted-open both absent | clinical/regulated/EduCloud student-facing lanes |

`sovereign` is stricter than `open_weight_only`: it excludes hosted-open
infrastructure too, not just proprietary weights. Sensitive workspaces remain a
*config variant with tiers absent*, never a runtime check. Mode is switched by
swapping the LiteLLM config variant — no code change (`specs/10` §"target
state"; `specs/11` Phase C). The flip from `hybrid` to `open_weight_only` is
triggered by the `proprietary_displacement` metric (§5.3), not by calendar or
preference.

## 4. Lane-specific verifiers (new — this is what makes "Science/Design" real)

The guard's principle — a runner decides, never the model — generalized per
lane. Without these, only Code was actually verifiable:

- **Code:** non-empty diff + lint + tests (existing), plus optional typecheck.
- **Science:** every citation must **resolve** (URL/DOI fetch 200 + title
  match); every keyed claim in the task's rubric present with a source;
  numbers in the report traceable to a fetched source or produced by included
  code; report re-runs from included code/data (reproducibility check).
  Hallucinated-citation rate is a first-class metric, not an anecdote.
- **Design:** build passes, accessibility lint (axe) clean, optional
  screenshot-diff against reference within threshold, design-token lint (no
  hardcoded values where tokens exist).
- **Cowork/plans:** per-subtask runnable acceptance commands + integration
  check (existing decomposer).

## 5. The Parity Bench — comparison suite (the centerpiece)

Purpose: test the full-open platform **against the subscriptions** — Claude
Code above all, Codex, and Perplexity — with results a skeptic would accept.

### 5.1 The confound, and the factorial design that removes it

"Open platform vs Claude Code" confounds **harness** with **model**. So the
core experiment is a 2×2 factorial, per task:

| | our harness (Portage) | native harness |
|---|---|---|
| **open model** | A1 (the platform) | A3 Claude Code → LiteLLM → open model |
| **frontier model** | A2 hybrid-ablation | A4 native Claude Code / Codex |

A1 vs A4 is the headline; A2 and A3 decompose any gap into *harness effect*
vs *model effect* vs their interaction. This is what makes a loss
diagnosable and a win credible.

### 5.2 Task suites (preregistered before any arm runs)

- **Code-private (n≈20–30):** real tasks from your repos (taskcapture,
  course-infra), each with a runnable acceptance check written *first*.
- **Code-public (n≈10):** a fixed SWE-bench-Verified-style sample for external
  comparability.
- **Science (n≈10–15):** research questions with keyed rubrics (required
  facts, resolvable-citation requirement). Perplexity Deep Research is the
  baseline arm here — **human-executed** (app-only), same wall-clock budget,
  outputs scored by the same rubric.
- **Cowork/multistage (n≈5):** plan-first tasks through the decomposer in
  each capable arm.

Preregistration = task list, acceptance checks, metrics, non-inferiority
margin, and analysis plan committed to the repo before run 1. All logs
published.

### 5.3 Metrics

**Primary**
1. **Verified success rate** (deterministic verifier; per lane).
2. **Cost per verified success**, under all three accounting models (§5.4).
3. **Wall-clock to verified success** (fixed per-task budget; timeout = fail).
4. **Human interventions** (count + minutes: clarifications answered,
   approvals, manual fixes).

**Secondary**
5. Escalation depth and win-tier distribution; 6. ceiling-stall rate;
7. human-fix edit distance (diff between agent output and what you actually
kept); 8. discard/revert rate; 9. Science lane: rubric coverage %, citation
resolvability %, hallucinated-citation rate; 10. tokens and energy proxy
(tokens × model size class) for the sovereignty story; 11. **`proprietary_displacement`**
— of currently-verified successes, what % would become ceiling-stalls if T7 were
removed today (the `hybrid` → `open_weight_only` flip trigger, tracked weekly);
12. **rescue efficiency** — proprietary dollars that converted a verified failure
into a verified success, divided by total proprietary dollars spent (T7 must earn
its place in flipped outcomes, not plausible-sounding output).

**Honesty gates (platform invariants applied to the benchmark)**
- **Non-inferiority first:** no arm may claim a cost/speed win unless its
  verified success rate is within a preregistered margin (default 5 pp) of
  the best arm on that suite. The stall-gate rule, generalized.
- Paired analysis only (same task across arms), bootstrap CIs on paired
  differences; no metric reported without its n.
- Thin-data label under preregistered minimum n, exactly as in
  `measure.py downscale`.

### 5.4 Cost accounting for flat subscriptions (novel, required)

Comparing per-token arms with flat-rate arms needs three prices, reported
side by side:

- **Marginal $/task** — API arms: tokens×price; subscription arms: ≈0.
- **Amortized $/task** — subscription price ÷ verified successes on that lane
  that month (the number that answers "is the subscription worth it").
- **Quota-share cost** — fraction of the binding cap consumed × subscription
  price (Claude: Opus cap tracked separately; Codex: Plus 5h window). The
  scarcity price of a "free" task.

Downscale decisions read amortized + quota-share; API-substitution decisions
read marginal. Conflating them is how every public comparison lies.

### 5.5 Runner

`bench.py` (build item): reads the preregistered suite, executes arms A1–A4
(A-Perplexity human-guided with a scripted checklist), enforces wall-clock
budgets, writes every attempt to the same Postgres/Langfuse schema the
platform already uses, and refuses to emit a summary that violates a gate.
Subscription arms run through Lane B non-interactive paths where automated,
respecting ToS (no multi-account, no scraping around limits).

## 6. Learning loop (closing the circle)

Verifier outcomes are the training signal: short-term, LiteLLM's adaptive
router updates per-request-type priors (documented to stabilize after ~10
requests per model); long-term, periodic RouteLLM-style retraining on the
Postgres log. **Availability events are excluded from this signal** — a rung
being asleep or off-network (`unavailable`) is capacity noise, not a quality
verdict, and must not poison priors or retraining data the way a real
`model_failed` should (see `specs/10`/`11`, `failup.py`). The benchmark suite
doubles as the evaluation set for router retraining — the platform literally
learns from the comparison against its competitors. Routing changes are
versioned; a retrained router must beat the prior router on the held-out suite
before deployment (same non-inferiority gate).

## 7. What was missing and is now added (explicit)

1. Lane-specific verifiers for Science and Design (§4) — without them the
   platform was a coding tool with aspirations.
2. **Open research stack** for the Science profile: SearXNG (self-hosted
   metasearch) + open fetch/crawl + the citation verifier. Required to test
   against Perplexity at all; also the sovereign research path.
3. The factorial ablation design (§5.1) and `bench.py`.
4. The three-model cost accounting (§5.4).
5. Learning-loop wiring with versioned, gated router updates (§6).
6. Artifact & session memory: Postgres-backed artifact store + generalized
   state snapshots (the PreCompact pattern platform-wide), so Cowork teams
   and Science reports persist across sessions and machines.
7. Profile definitions as config (Code/Science/Design/Cowork = interaction
   profiles: system prompts, toolsets, verifiers, default tiers) — the
   product-surface analogue without cloning vendor features.
8. A working name, a license decision to make (recommend Apache-2.0 to match
   the stack), and this document as the single source of truth.
9. **The steward model** (`specs/09`): one warm local model doing all five
   pre-dispatch jobs — triage, classify, route, shape, propose acceptance
   checks — prompted+rules now, verifier-fine-tuned later. Prompt shaping is
   additive-only with the original always preserved, so it is measurable
   rather than assumed. Its training label is the deterministic verifier's
   verdict, which makes the platform's ground truth do double duty: it trains
   the router (§6) and the steward from the same records.

## 8. Honest limits

- **OpenHands is a large dependency.** Adopt its control plane; keep our core
  (guard, triage, verifiers, metrics) framework-agnostic so it survives a
  substrate change.
- **Benchmark labor is real.** Full suite × 4 arms is days of runtime and
  attention. Start with a 12-task pilot cut to debug the runner and rubrics
  before the preregistered run.
- **The Perplexity arm cannot be automated** (consumer tier is app-only); its
  protocol is human-executed and therefore noisier — say so in reporting.
- **Open-model pricing/rankings in the overview are point-in-time** (DeepSeek
  V4 Flash, Qwen3-Coder, Gemma 4 etc.); the ladder is config, re-checked at
  bench time, never hardcoded in claims.
- The learning loop needs volume; until a few hundred verified outcomes
  exist, adaptive routing priors are weak — run static ladder + fail-up
  until the log earns the learner.
- Subscription arms are moving targets (models, limits, harness updates);
  every benchmark report carries a date and exact versions, and comparisons
  expire.

## 9. Build-order delta (appends to HANDOFF.md)

**Phase 6a** (new, inserted before Phase 6 — see `REVISION-PLAN.md` §5): wire
OpenRouter (allowlisted) + Together as LiteLLM deployment groups; wire T7
(Anthropic/OpenAI/Perplexity PAYG) with per-task-class budgets and the
boundary gate; split `unavailable` vs `model_failed` in `failup.py`; add
displacement + rescue-efficiency reporting to `measure.py`; run the 12-task
pilot cut (A1 vs A4) **while subscriptions are still live**, then cancel them.
This is config + telemetry, not new architecture — it operationalizes modes
already defined in §3.

Phase 7: lane verifiers (science citation-resolver first) + open research
stack. Phase 8: Postgres outcome store + Langfuse wiring; migrate measure.py
metrics onto it (keep the JSONL path as fallback). Phase 9: `bench.py` +
preregistration templates + the 12-task pilot. Phase 10: adaptive-router
enablement + first gated RouteLLM retrain, and steward Phase B/C
(distillation bootstrap, then verifier-tuned fine-tune) — both gated by the
same held-out non-inferiority rule. OpenHands adoption can proceed in
parallel from Phase 7; nothing earlier depends on it.
