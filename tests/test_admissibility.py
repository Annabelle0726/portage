"""CC-P4: an unreachable tier is not evidence that the tier could not do the task.

Fixtures only — every log record here is written by hand. Zero network, zero
model calls, and no subprocess at all except in the one case that has to
exercise the guard itself (`test_log_record_carries_both_reason_and_reason_code`,
which uses the same stub runner the rest of the suite does).

The rule under test, stated once: a run is admissible capability evidence only
if every tier BELOW its winning tier produced a capability verdict. The tempting
fix — dropping `category == "availability"` records before reconstructing — is
what cases 1 and 3 exist to rule out: it would make case 1's run look like a task
that genuinely started at tier 1, which is the same bias with the volume turned
down.
