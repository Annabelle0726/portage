distill — turn the platform's own verifier logs into training data.

STATUS (CW02 §2.4, 2026-07-28): PARKED until HB-4 / S4. This exists ahead of
its phase — the herdr-build-plan lists distill.py as unwritten; it is written,
but it must gain the collapse guards (class-weighted labels, exploration
fraction, per-tier recall + CNA tracking) before any training run consumes
its output.

The key property (docs/specs/09 §4): this platform LABELS ITSELF. No hand annotation.

  routing (R2)   the CHEAPEST TIER THAT PASSED is the correct route, by
                 construction. The fail-up guard produces perfect labels as a
                 side effect of doing its job.
  triage  (R1)   tasks that needed a clarification vs. tasks that one-shot at
                 the floor = a natural specified/underspecified split.
  adapt   (R3)   template_id x verified outcome = which template wins per
                 (lane, model class).

Emits JSONL ready for LoRA SFT (messages format) plus a report on whether there
is enough signal to bother training yet.

  distill.py --project . --role routing --out data/routing.jsonl
  distill.py --project . --report

HONEST LIMIT (docs/specs/09 §6): these labels come from your own ladder, so a model
trained on them learns YOUR ladder, not the optimal one. Keep a held-out,
human-judged slice as an anchor, and gate every adapter on the platform's
non-inferiority rule before it ships.
