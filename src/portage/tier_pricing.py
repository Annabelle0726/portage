"""
HB-2b: the explicit, honest mapping between `.claude/tiers.json` rung names
and `registry.yaml` aliases — the gap HB0-report.md §4 item 1 named as
"explicit HB-2 scope" and HB-2/HB-2b's own reports left open rather than
guess at.

WHY THIS IS A SMALL STATIC TABLE AND NOT A FULL RECONCILIATION. The two
vocabularies were never going to unify cleanly: `sonnet`/`opus` are Lane A,
subscription-billed through the native Max wallet, and CC-P6 deleted
`proprietary_code` from the registry OUTRIGHT — there is no row for them and
there should not be one (see that deletion's own comment in registry.yaml).
`local-big` and `sovereign-work` named a local-big-model tier and a Scale-2
sovereign-HPC tier that CW-04 §2.4 and the Scale-1 registry never built —
mapping them to something would be inventing a row, not recording one.

So this module maps ONLY where a real, unambiguous correspondence exists, and
says so explicitly for every rung that has no honest answer. `measure.py`
reads `RUNG_TO_ALIAS` and `price_for_rung()` reads `runner-reported cost`
first (from `failup.py`'s `--output-format json` capture) BEFORE ever
consulting the registry — for `sonnet`/`opus` that is the ONLY correct price
source, since it's what the Max wallet actually billed, and registry price
fields for those rungs would just be null anyway.

    Precedence, in order:
      1. `cost_usd` — the runner's own reported spend (HB-2b's
         `--output-format json` capture). Authoritative when present: it is
         what actually got billed, not an estimate from a price table.
      2. A registry lookup, only when every enabled occupant of the alias
         `model` maps to prices IDENTICALLY (not "there's only one occupant"
         — `code_small`'s two local occupants both cost $0, so which one
         served this call doesn't change the answer). A multi-occupant alias
         whose occupants differ (e.g. `code_large`: $0.14 vs $0.30 vs $3.00)
         can't be priced from the rung name alone, because which occupant
         actually served this call isn't recoverable from a
         `.claude/tiers.json` rung name, and guessing with the cheapest
         occupant would understate cost for exactly the calls that escalated
         past it.
