Fail-up guard (Lane B) — the thing that makes escalation flawless.

Runs an automated coding task at an assigned tier, then verifies it
DETERMINISTICALLY (the agent changed something + it's coherent + tests pass).
On failure it parks the attempt, resets clean, and retries ONE TIER UP, to the
ceiling. No model call in the guard itself, so a misrouted hard task can't die
on a too-cheap model — it fails the check and self-corrects to Opus.

This is why you don't need a sophisticated classifier: cheap heuristics can be
wrong, because the guard catches the misses.

The deterministic gate itself is no longer inline: it is the `code` profile of
the verifier contract (`code_profile.py` here, `SPEC.md` in the sibling
verifier-contract repository), reached through `code_verdict()`. The escalation
logic below is unchanged and now reads a verdict document instead of a
`(bool, reason)` pair.

HB-2 adds one same-tier retry (`failure_classes.MAX_ATTEMPTS_PER_TIER`, and see
that module's docstring for the five-class taxonomy it names): a tier gets up
to two attempts before the ladder escalates, and a retry's prompt carries the
prior attempt's structured verdict (`_retry_feedback()`) so the SAME stage sees
what it got wrong, rather than the retry being a blind repeat.
